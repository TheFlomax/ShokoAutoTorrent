## Prerequisites
- Requires Shoko Server to provide the API. Not affiliated with the Shoko project.
- Website: https://shokoanime.com/ ‚Äî Docs: https://docs.shokoanime.com/

## Quickstart (Docker Compose)
1) Copy env example.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
2) Edit `.env` (if a password contains $, use `$$`)
3) Start in background
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
4) Tail logs (optional)
```bash
docker compose logs -f shoko-auto-torrent
```

Minimal compose
```yaml
services:
  shoko-auto-torrent:
    image: ghcr.io/theflomax/shokoautotorrent:latest
    container_name: shoko-auto-torrent
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - config:/app/config
    # To edit a local file instead of the named volume:
    #  - ./config.yaml:/app/config/config.yaml:ro

volumes:
  config:
```

## Configuration
- Variables in `.env` (SHOKO_URL, SHOKO_API_KEY, QBIT_URL, QBIT_USERNAME, QBIT_PASSWORD, SAVE_ROOT, DRY_RUN, EARLY_EXIT, SCHEDULE_INTERVAL_HOURS)
- If your qBittorrent uses an invalid HTTPS cert, set `qbittorrent.verify_cert: false` and/or `qbittorrent.prefer_http: true` in config.yaml.
- A default config is bundled in the image and reads environment variables.
- Named volume `config` (mounted at `/app/config`) persists your configuration.
- Seed the volume once with the default config:
```bash
docker compose run --rm --user root shoko-auto-torrent \
  sh -c 'install -d -o 1000 -g 1000 /app/config && [ -f /app/config/config.yaml ] || install -o 1000 -g 1000 -m 644 /app/config.yaml /app/config/config.yaml'
```
- Or mount a local file: `- ./config.yaml:/app/config/config.yaml:ro`

## Usage (key options)
- `--dry-run` forces simulation (overrides config/env)
- `--limit` caps the number of processed episodes
- `--lang` sets output language (`fr` or `en`)

## Notes
- Main source: https://nyaa.si/user/Tsundere-Raws (RSS)
- You can add the source in `config.yaml` by adding nyaa.si usernames (ex: `users: [Tsundere-Raws, Arcedo, Erai-raws]`).
- Title parsing pattern: `[Title] S##E## VOSTFR 1080p WEB ‚Ä¶ -Tsundere-Raws (CR)`
- SQLite cache avoids repeated searches

Shoko Auto Torrent automates search and queuing of torrents via RSS and qBittorrent.
It is intended for legitimate uses (e.g., automating downloads of content you are authorized to access). It must not be used to download illegal, harmful, or unauthorized content.

### Administrator Responsibility

As a self-hosted tool, operators are solely responsible for:

- Compliance with all applicable local, national, and international laws
- Proper configuration and security of their environment (Shoko, qBittorrent, network, etc.)
- Monitoring and moderating what is downloaded through their setup
- Defining and enforcing appropriate usage policies for users of their environment

### Recommended Practices

We strongly recommend that operators:

- Restrict access to the environment (Shoko/qBittorrent) with proper authentication
